"""Misfit between the modelled and the radar-observed cold-temperate transition surface.

Input : GPR profiles in `data/cts_gpr/cts_<glacier>-<year>*.csv`, and the enthalpy
        fields `E` / `E_pmp` held in the model state at the end of the run.
Output: `state.score["cost_cts"]`, the mean per-profile RMSE in metres.

`state.score` is what `igm_run` serialises for the Optuna sweeper, so this module is
what turns the example into a calibration problem: it is loaded in Step 2 and left out
of Step 1. The cost is computed once, in `finalize`, on the final thermal state — the
observations are a single 2022 snapshot, so there is nothing to track through time.
