### <h1 align="center" id="title">IGM module `make_synthetic` </h1>

# Description:

This IGM module makes a synthetic glacier bedrock with zero thickness for a simple test of a given U-shaped in X, and linearly inclinated in Y to mimic a valley glacier defined in a 10 km x 20 km large rectangle, with 100 m of spatial resolution. This module can be taken as a template for producing other synhtetic bedrock topographies. The module return topg, thk, usurf defining a synthetic case glacier.
